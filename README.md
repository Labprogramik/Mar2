 <p>
  <b>Marian</b> (formerly known as AmuNMT) is an efficient Neural Machine Translation framework written
  in pure C++ with minimal dependencies. It has mainly been developed at the
  Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (AMU) and at the University of Edinburgh.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is currently being deployed in
  multiple European projects and is the main translation and training engine
  behind the neural MT launch at the
  <a href="http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2016/article_0014.html">World Intellectual Property Organization</a>.

  </p>

  <p>
  Main features:
  <ul>
    <li> Fast multi-gpu training and translation </li>
    <li> Compatible with Nematus and DL4MT </li>
    <li> Efficient pure C++ implementation </li>
    <li> Permissive open source license (MIT) </li>

## Recommended software

### GPU version

**Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (tested and recommended).** For Ubuntu 16.04 the standard
packages should work. On newer versions of Ubuntu, e.g. 16.10, there may be
problems due to incompatibilities of the default g++ compiler and CUDA.

 * CMake 3.5.1 (default)
 * GCC/G++ 5.4 (default)
 * Boost 1.58 (default)
 * CUDA 8.0

**Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.** A newer CMake version than the default version is
required and can be installed from source.

 * CMake 3.5.1 (due to CUDA related bugs in earlier versions)
 * GCC/G++ 4.9
 * Boost 1.54
 * CUDA 8.0

### CPU version

The CPU-only version will automatically be compiled if CUDA cannot be detected by CMake.
Only the translator will be compiled, the training framework is strictily GPU-based.

Tested on different machines and distributions:

 * CMake 3.5.1
 * The CPU version should be a lot more forgiving concerning GCC/G++ or Boost versions.

#### macOS

To be able to make the CPU version on macOS, first install [brew](https://brew.sh/) and then run:

    brew install cmake boost

    # Python 2 default
    brew install boost-python

    # Python 3
    brew install boost-python --with-python3

Then, proceed to the next section.

## Download and Compilation

Clone a fresh copy from github:

    git clone https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian.git

The project is a standard CMake out-of-source build:

    cd marian
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j

If run for the first time, this will also download Marian -- the training
framework for Marian.

Other cmake options:

-  Build the CPU-only version of `amun` (training is GPU-only)

       cmake .. -DCUDA=off

-  Adding debugging symbols (for use with gdb, etc)

       cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

- Specifying Python version to compile against

       # Linux
       cmake .. -DPYTHON_VERSION=2.7
       cmake .. -DPYTHON_VERSION=3.5
       cmake .. -DPYTHON_VERSION=3.6

       # macOS
       cmake .. -DPYTHON_VERSION=2
       cmake .. -DPYTHON_VERSION=3


### Compile Python bindings

In order to compile the Python library, after running _make_ as in the previous section, do:

    make python

This will generate a _libamunmt.dylib_ or _libamunmt.so_ in your `build/src/` directory, which can be imported from Python.

## Running Marian

### Training

Assuming `corpus.en` and `corpus.ro` are
corresponding and preprocessed files of a English-Romanian parallel corpus, the
following command will create a Nematus-compatible neural machine translation model.

    ./marian/build/marian \
      --train-sets corpus.en corpus.ro \
      --vocabs vocab.en vocab.ro \
      --model model.npz

See the [documentation](https://marian-nmt.github.io/docs/#marian) for a full list
of command line options or the
[examples](https://marian-nmt.github.io/examples/training) for a full example of
how to train a WMT-grade model.

### Translating

If a trained model is available, run:

    ./marian/build/amun -m model.npz -s vocab.en -t vocab.ro <<< "This is a test ."

See the [documentation](https://marian-nmt.github.io/docs/#amun) for a full list of
command line options or the
[examples](https://marian-nmt.github.io/examples/translating) for a full example of
how to use Edinburgh's WMT models for translation.

## Example usage

* **[Translating with Amun](https://marian-nmt.github.io/examples/translating/)**:
The files and scripts described in this section can be found in
`amunmt/examples/translate`. They demonstrate how to translate with Amun using
Edinburgh's German-English WMT2016 single model and ensemble.
* **[Training with Marian](https://marian-nmt.github.io/examples/training/)**: The files
and scripts described in this section can be found in
`marian/examples/training`. They have been adapted from the
Romanian-English sample from <https://github.com/rsennrich/wmt16-scripts>.
We also add the back-translated data from <http://data.statmt.org/rsennrich/wmt16_backtranslations/>
as desribed in [Edinburgh's WMT16 paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-2323).
The resulting system should be competitive or even slightly better than
reported in that paper.
* **[Winning system of the WMT 2016 APE shared task](https://marian-nmt.github.io/examples/postedit/)**:
This page provides data and model files for our shared task winning APE system
described in [Log-linear Combinations of Monolingual and Bilingual Neural
Machine Translation Models for Automatic
Post-Editing](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-2378).
